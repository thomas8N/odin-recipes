        <h2>20 minutes recipe!</h2>

        <p>This <strong>Creamy Chicken Pasta recipe</strong> is so dependable, it's one of those staple weeknight dinners that we all need in our repertoire. It is comforting, insanely delicious and comes together in about 20 minutes. A creamy sauce loaded with garlic and parmesan cheese but freshened up with lemon to cut through the richness. I know the whole family will love it!
        </p>    
        
        <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boneless Skinless Chicken breasts</strong> - I use one for two people but use two if you like. Using a rolling pin (to hit it!) I flatten the breast down to an even thickness so it cooks quickly and evenly. I do personally prefer the flavor of chicken thighs so use either.</li>

            <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - Fresh garlic cloves always if you can!</li>

            <li><strong>Cream</strong> -I like to use single or light cream because the Parmesan thickens the sauce beautifully as it simmers. If you're in the U.S. and using heavy cream, that works perfectly too as you can thin it with a splash of pasta water at the end if the sauce gets too thick.</li>

            <li><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong> - Freshly grated with a microplane or star side of a box grater. Pre grated parmesan is often full of additives and won't melt into a sauce as well.

            <li><strong>Lemon Juice</strong> - I add fresh lemon juice to 99% of my creamy pasta sauces, it cuts through the richness perfectly.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Additions:</strong>

        <p>I wanted to keep this as a really simple base but it is crying out to be added to! Try any of these:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Toasted sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>-Any fresh vegetables like broccoli, zucchini or green beans.   
            </li>
            <li> A big fresh vegetables like broccoli, zucchini or green beans</li>
            <li>A big handful or fresh spinach    
            </li>
            <li>Some cooked crispy bacon pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How to make this recipe</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Flatten the chicken breast down so it is all the same thickness. I get out some frustration by hitting it with a rolling pin on a cutting board!</li>
            <li>For best results, flatten it to about 1 - 1.5cm thick for best results.</li>
            <li>Season each side well with salt and black pepper. Dust with flour (optional but it adds a lovely golden crisp finish).</li>
            <li>Pan fry over a medium-high heat for 2 minutes each side until golden brown (or longer if your piece is thicker). Wrap lightly in foil and make the sauce.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Add ¼ cup of pasta water.</li>
            <li>Add the black pepper and lemon juice and mix in quickly. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes to thicken.</li>
            <li>Add your cooked pasta in and toss well. Let it gently bubble away in the sauce for 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice the chicken breast and serve with extra fresh rosemary and lemon zest. Some red pepper flakes would also be delish.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>200 grams dried pasta or 300 grams fresh pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 x chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves roughly chopped</li>
            <li>¾ cup cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>50 grams parmesan very finely grated</li>
            <li>Lemon zest and extra rosemary to finish</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Instructions</strong>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook your pasta in well salted boiling water, undercooking by 1 minute. Reserve a cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>Flatten the chicken breast to an even thickness (about 1-1.5cm), I do this by laying some plastic wrap over the top and hitting with a rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Season the breast well with salt and pepper on each side then dust with the flour.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a fry pan over a medium high heat and fry the chicken for 2 mins each side (or until cooked through if yours is thicker).</li>
            <li>Lightly wrap in foil and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter over a medium heat and gently fry the garlic for a minute, it shouldn't brown at all.
            </li>
            <li>Add the rosemary and cook for a further 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour in the cream and bring to a very gentle simmer (lower the heat if you need, it shouldn't be boiling).</li>
            <li>Add the parmesan in 2 or 3 separate lots, mixing and letting it melt in between each addition.</li>
            <li>Add the pepper and lemon juice and mix in quickly.</li>
            <li>Add ¼ cup of pasta water and let it gently simmer for a 2 - 3 minutes to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta, toss and let it gently bubble away for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Slice the chicken then serve the pasta with the chicken pieces on top or tossed through.</li>
            <li>I like to top with some extra rosemary leaves, freshly grated lemon zest and some more parmesan if you wish.</li>
