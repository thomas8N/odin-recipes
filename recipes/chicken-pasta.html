        <h2>20 minutes recipe!</h2>

        <p>This <strong>Creamy Chicken Pasta recipe</strong> is so dependable, it's one of those staple weeknight dinners that we all need in our repertoire. It is comforting, insanely delicious and comes together in about 20 minutes. A creamy sauce loaded with garlic and parmesan cheese but freshened up with lemon to cut through the richness. I know the whole family will love it!

        <h3>Main Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boneless Skinless Chicken breasts</strong> - I use one for two people but use two if you like. Using a rolling pin (to hit it!) I flatten the breast down to an even thickness so it cooks quickly and evenly. I do personally prefer the flavor of chicken thighs so use either.</li>

            <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - Fresh garlic cloves always if you can!</li>

            <li><strong>Cream</strong> -I like to use single or light cream because the Parmesan thickens the sauce beautifully as it simmers. If you're in the U.S. and using heavy cream, that works perfectly too as you can thin it with a splash of pasta water at the end if the sauce gets too thick.</li>

            <li><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong> - Freshly grated with a microplane or star side of a box grater. Pre grated parmesan is often full of additives and won't melt into a sauce as well.

            <li><strong>Lemon Juice</strong> - I add fresh lemon juice to 99% of my creamy pasta sauces, it cuts through the richness perfectly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Additions:</h4>

        <p>I wanted to keep this as a really simple base but it is crying out to be added to! Try any of these:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Toasted sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>-Any fresh vegetables like broccoli, zucchini or green beans.   
            </li>
            <li> A big fresh vegetables like broccoli, zucchini or green beans</li>
            <li>A big handful or fresh spinach    
            </li>
            <li>Some cooked crispy bacon pieces</li>
        </ul>
